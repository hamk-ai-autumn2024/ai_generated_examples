## Getting Started

### 1. Conceptual Learning (No Installation Required)

Start by exploring the learning resources:

1. **Open `index.html`** in your browser to navigate all resources
2. **Read the Comprehensive Tutorial** (`flask_tutorial.html`) for a complete overview
3. **Review the Learning Summary** (`flask_learning_summary.md`) for detailed explanations

### 2. Hands-On Practice (Installation Required)

To run the practical examples, you'll need to install Flask:

1. **Install Flask** by following the instructions in `install_flask.html`
2. **Run the Example Application**:
   - On Windows: Double-click `run_flask_example.bat`
   - On macOS/Linux: Run `python flask_example.py` in your terminal
3. **Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5001`** in your browser

### 3. Alternative Example

We've also included an alternative Flask example in the `flask_demo/` directory:

1. Navigate to the `flask_demo` directory
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`
4. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser
